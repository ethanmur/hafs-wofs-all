# HAFS & WoFS rainfall verification

Case-driven tools for evaluating tropical-cyclone quantitative precipitation
forecasts. The current implementation covers HAFS-A and HAFS-B; WoFS and
multi-storm aggregation are planned extensions.

The framework supports three analysis levels:

1. One model initialization: QPF maps, categorical skill, and continuous
   errors.
2. Every eligible initialization of one model: a fixed-window comparison that
   isolates lead-time differences.
3. HAFS-A versus HAFS-B for one initialization: a head-to-head comparison over
   a shared NHC best-track footprint.

## Setup

On Orion or Hercules:

```bash
module load miniconda3
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hafs
```

The main dependencies are NumPy, SciPy, PyYAML, boto3, cfgrib, ecCodes,
xarray, Matplotlib, Cartopy, Seaborn, and Pillow. `environment.yml` is preferred because it
installs the required native GRIB and mapping libraries.

MRMS observations are downloaded anonymously from NOAA's public S3 bucket.
Stage IV files are downloaded from `water.noaa.gov`. Downloads are cached in
`/tmp/mrms_cache` and `/tmp/stage4_cache` unless a YAML file overrides those
locations.

## Expected HAFS layout

A model root should contain one `YYYYMMDDHH` directory per initialization:

```text
/work2/.../helene/HFSA/
  2024092400/
    09l.2024092400.hfsa.parent.trak.atcfunix
    09l.2024092400.hfsa.parent.atm.f000.grb2
    09l.2024092400.hfsa.parent.atm.f003.grb2
    ...
    09l.2024092400.hfsa.storm.atm.f000.grb2
    09l.2024092400.hfsa.storm.atm.f003.grb2
    ...
  2024092412/
  ...
```

Large model data and generated products are intentionally excluded from Git.

## Run one initialization

A per-initialization YAML points to the model root or initialization directory:

```yaml
run_dir: /work2/.../helene/HFSA
storm_name: Hurricane Helene
init: 2024092400
domain: [15.0, 42.0, -100.0, -60.0]
mask_radius_km: 500
out_dir: analysis/output/helene_hfsa
```

Run all products or select one:

```bash
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_hfsa.yaml all
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_hfsa.yaml parent
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_hfsa.yaml ets
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_hfsa.yaml rmse
```

`all` builds the expensive verification fields once and shares them between
the ETS and continuous-error products.

Outputs are initialization-tagged and written below the configured `out_dir`:

```text
parent_qpf_<case>_<init>.png    nest + parent + MRMS + Stage IV QPF
ets_full_<case>_<init>.png     ETS versus rainfall threshold
ets_full_<case>_<init>.csv     contingency counts and categorical scores
rmse_scatter_<case>_<init>.png forecast-versus-observed scatter panels
rmse_<case>_<init>.csv         RMSE, MAE, bias, and correlation
```

## Compare every initialization of one model

This is the scalable workflow for roughly ten pre-landfall runs. A single YAML
describes a storm, model, and absolute verification window; initialization
directories are discovered automatically.

```yaml
run_root: /work2/.../helene/HFSA
valid_start: 2024092600
valid_end: 2024092800
landfall_time: 202409270310
storm_name: Hurricane Helene
domain: [15.0, 42.0, -100.0, -60.0]
mask_radius_km: 500
out_dir: analysis/output/helene_hfsa_cycles
```

Run either model with its corresponding config:

```bash
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_hfsa_cycles.yaml cycles
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_hfsb_cycles.yaml cycles
```

Cycles initialized before `valid_start` accumulate from `valid_start`; later
cycles accumulate from their initialization. Every cycle must extend through
the common `valid_end` and is verified against MRMS/Stage IV accumulated over
its matching interval. The output CSV records each cycle's effective start and
end. Use an optional `inits:` list only when automatic discovery should be
restricted. `landfall_time` enables a common "hours before landfall" axis; it
accepts `YYYYMMDDHH` or `YYYYMMDDHHMM` UTC.

Scores use one shared spatial swath: the union of all surviving forecast-track
positions within their effective windows. Because later initializations use
shorter accumulation periods, interpret cycle-to-cycle changes together with
the recorded valid window.

Cycle outputs are:

```text
cycles_<case>_<start>_<end>.csv
cycles_fss_<case>_<start>_<end>.csv
cycles_metrics_<case>_<start>_<end>.png
cycles_ets_heatmap_<case>_<start>_<end>.png
cycles_ets_bars_<case>_<start>_<end>.png
cycles_fss_heatmap_<case>_<start>_<end>.png
cycles_qpf_<case>_<start>_<end>.gif
cycles_difference_<case>_<start>_<end>.gif
cycles_observed_<case>_<start>_<end>.gif
```

The multi-cycle products use only the fixed parent domain. ETS is shown as a
Seaborn heatmap of rainfall threshold by initialization; FSS uses one Seaborn
heatmap per rainfall threshold, with neighborhood scale by initialization.
The model-level ETS bar chart follows the paper-style 2–24 inch threshold axis
and pools contingency counts across cycles before calculating ETS. The suite
also includes separate parent-forecast, parent-minus-MRMS, and observed-MRMS
animations. The
observed animation remains visually static while its accumulation window is
unchanged. Set `make_animation: false` to skip all three GIFs.
Optional `ets_bar_thresholds_in`,
`fss_thresholds_in` and `fss_scales_cells` lists control the bar-chart and FSS
thresholds/scales.

To compare the cycle tables from HAFS-A, HAFS-B, and HAFS-M, run:

```bash
python3 analysis/run.py storms/helene_cycles_compare.yaml cycles-compare
```

This creates grouped ETS bars and a scale-dependent FSS comparison in
`analysis/output/helene_cycles_compare`. A configured model without cycle
CSVs—currently HAFS-M—is retained in the legend as “awaiting data.” After its
files arrive, update `storms/helene_hfsm_cycles.yaml`, run that model's
`cycles` command, and rerun `cycles-compare`.

## Compare HAFS-A and HAFS-B

The two case YAMLs must describe the same storm and initialization. Download
the storm's NHC ATCF b-deck and reference it from a comparison YAML:

```yaml
label: Hurricane Helene
cases:
  - storms/helene_hfsa.yaml
  - storms/helene_hfsb.yaml
best_track: /work2/.../bal092024.dat
out_dir: analysis/output/helene_compare
```

```bash
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_compare.yaml compare
```

Both configurations are evaluated on the same best-track swath and common
finite-data coverage. Products include categorical curves, FSS by
neighborhood scale, a performance diagram, storm-total maps and exceedance
areas, and RMW-normalized storm-relative composites. CSVs contain the complete
categorical and FSS matrices.

Existing comparison CSVs can be replotted without reopening GRIB files:

```bash
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_compare.yaml replot
```

## Compare observational datasets

No HAFS forecast involved: validates MRMS, Stage IV, and AORC against each
other before any of them is trusted as verification truth elsewhere in this
repo. Every product is put on one common grid first (`regrid-obs`, via MET),
and the comparisons run on that regridded output over the full `domain`; the
best track is drawn on every map.

```yaml
storm_name: Hurricane Helene
best_track: /work2/.../bal092024.dat
valid_start: 2024092400
valid_end:   2024092906
domain: [15.0, 42.0, -100.0, -60.0]

out_dir:          analysis/output/helene_obs_compare
mrms_cache_dir:   /work2/.../mrms_cache
stage4_cache_dir: /work2/.../stage4_cache_hourly
aorc_cache_dir:   /work2/.../noaa_aorc

skip_mrms: false
skip_stage4: false
skip_aorc: false
```

Downloading and comparing are two separate commands, so a no-internet compute
node can run the comparison against data a login node already fetched:

```bash
# On a login node (has internet): fetch and cache raw MRMS/AORC only -- no
# regridding, no plotting, sequential requests only. Stage IV hourly data
# is NOT fetched here -- place ST4.<YYYYMMDD> files under stage4_cache_dir
# yourself (see analysis/stage4_hourly.py) before running regrid-obs.
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_obs_compare.yaml download-obs

# On a compute node: regrid every cached obs hour onto the HAFS parent grid
# with MET regrid_data_plane (BUDGET by default), cached as NetCDF under
# regrid.cache_dir. Needs `module load met/12.2.0`. Hours already regridded
# are skipped; the per-hour conservation check is always rewritten.
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_obs_compare.yaml regrid-obs

# Hourly maps of the regrid-obs output, under regrid_plots.out_dir:
#   compare-regrid/<source>_{full,zoom}_<YYYYMMDDHH>.png  native vs regridded
#   compare-products/products_full_<...>.png  MRMS | Stage IV | AORC regridded
#   compare-anomaly/anomaly_full_<...>.png    AORC | AORC-MRMS | AORC-Stage IV
# The zoom box is regrid_plots.zoom_domain. Headers quote the area-mean
# change from the regrid-obs conservation CSV when it exists.
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_obs_compare.yaml plot-regrid

# Distributions and cell-by-cell 1:1 comparisons of the regridded products,
# per hour and over the whole window, land-only (AORC coverage) and
# including ocean, plus stats_sources_/stats_pairs_ CSVs. Each pair uses the
# cells where both products report, so MRMS-vs-Stage IV keeps the ocean.
python analysis/run.py storms/helene_obs_compare.yaml stats-regrid
```

`regrid-obs` hands MET exactly one unambiguous field per file: the cached
MRMS GRIB2 as-is, the single finest-grid 1h message cut out of the
multi-record `ST4.<day>` file, and AORC written as an equivalent 1-hour APCP
GRIB2 message (its 0.008333° grid is exact in GRIB2's microdegree units). Its
`regrid_budget_<case>.csv` compares, per source per hour, MET's area-weighted
mean over the common valid area against an exact box average of the native
field; rows beyond `tolerance_pct` (and 0.01 mm) are flagged `CHECK`. The
target grid is whatever `regrid.grid_template` points at — note HAFS parent
domains can differ between cycles, so pick a template covering the whole case
window (the run warns if part of `domain` falls outside it).

All three sources are individually skippable
(`skip_mrms` / `skip_stage4` / `skip_aorc` — a skipped source is left out of
every panel and pairing rather than erroring). Stage IV hourly values come
from NCEP's own `ST4.<YYYYMMDD>` archive files, which bundle a file's 1h
message alongside its 6h/24h ones for every hour of the day; `stage4_hourly.py`
reads only the 1h messages, keyed by each message's GRIB-decoded
accumulation-end time (the same hour-end convention MRMS/AORC already use).

AORC (`s3://noaa-nws-aorc-v1-1-1km`, 1-km hourly, no AWS account needed) is
one Zarr store per year rather than per-timestep files — opened lazily via
`s3fs`/`xarray.open_zarr`, sliced to the requested hour, and cached locally
as a small per-hour NetCDF so repeat runs never re-touch S3.

## Verification details

- The fixed HAFS parent grid uses its cumulative `0 -> forecast hour` APCP
  record.
- The moving nest cannot use its storm-relative cumulative APCP as a
  geographic storm total. The code regrids and sums short, geographically
  valid incremental buckets instead.
- MRMS uses hourly gauge-corrected multisensor QPE accumulated over the exact
  requested window.
- Stage IV is CONUS-only and consists of 12Z-to-12Z daily products. Summing
  touched days approximates windows that do not align to those boundaries;
  figures and CSV workflows retain that caveat.
- Categorical outputs include ETS, CSI, frequency bias, POD, FAR, and HSS.
- Continuous outputs include RMSE, MAE, mean bias, and Pearson correlation.
- FSS evaluates spatial displacement tolerance across neighborhood sizes.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest analysis/tests -q
```

Tests use synthetic fields and small track fixtures; they do not require the
HPC model archive or observation downloads.
